To do
=====

- Replace arrow aiming with crank wheel touch controls
- Replace arrow power with slider touch controls
X Automatically adjust transparency when hovering/not hovering over controls
X Change crank wheel, slider handle and text color to match player turn
- Hide UI text before round start (so it doesn't start white)
- Test on Android
X Investigate UI control size on different resolutions (currently using HD landscape, but then it's too big on smaller resolutions)

- Add round start/end + winner messages
- Weapon select
- Revamp tank disable/enable at end of turn
- Add simple enemy AI
- Number of players menu and human/AI selection
- Random spawn points
- Better weapon tracer
