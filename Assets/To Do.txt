To do
=====

X Replace arrow aiming with crank wheel touch controls
X Replace arrow power with slider touch controls
X Automatically adjust transparency when hovering/not hovering over controls
X Change crank wheel, slider handle and text color to match player turn
X Hide UI text before round start (so it doesn't start white)
X Test on Android
X Investigate UI control size on different resolutions (currently using HD landscape, but then it's too big on smaller resolutions)
- Change the method-jumping to directly reference the tank components (changed to public)

- Verify that damage and explosion force calculations work correctly
- Add round start/end + winner messages
- Weapon select
- Revamp tank disable/enable at end of turn
- Add simple enemy AI
- Number of players menu and human/AI selection
- Random spawn points
- Better weapon tracer
- Better particle effects



Bugs
====
- First player can double-tap fire to shoot twice
- Red player sometimes fires in a weird angle when pushing button too soon. Is the game perhaps still using yellow's location and turret angle?
